# Assignment 4: Cybersecurity

For this assignment you can choose from 2 variants:

- [Prepare a demo](#demo-cybersecurity-attack) where you show how a typical cybersecurity attack works
- Participate with your team in the [Cybersecurity Challenge](#cyber-security-challenge-belgium).

## Demo cybersecurity attack

As a young team, you decide to also focus on the (growing) market of **Cybersecurity**. The services you want to offer are a Security Audit by means of [Penetration Testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_test). Since it is impossible to develop all these activities without an income or contract, you decide to show only one demo to the customer to convince them of your expertise - in the hope of winning a contract.

You develop a demo that completely simulates an existing, known attack. You are looking for a demo that you find relevant, and that you also consider feasible for the skills of your own team. Making an impression is allowed.

Practically, you set this up in a virtual environment, where e.g. one VM is the attacker, and one VM is the computer you are trying to penetrate. Additional devices (routers, servers, ...) can be placed in your environment according to what you need inorder to be able to give your demo. You provide the necessary documentation so that on the one hand any of the team members can easily give the demo, and on the other hand the customer understands conceptually what exactly is going on (without having to know all the commands).

### Acceptance criteria

- You show a working demo of a (known) Cybersecurity attack
    - On the one hand, you explain the principle behind the demonstrated attack. What weaknesses in a system are exploited?
    - On the other hand, you show that you have found the necessary tools and can make them work to carry out the attack effectively.
- Make the (virtual) environment in which you have prepared everything available online in a VirtualBox OVA file (not within the Github repository!).
- Provide the necessary documentation
    - technical documentation that enables all team members and supervisors to set up the environment without having to ask for help
    - *white paper* targeted to potential customers that explains in a comprehensible way how the attack works, and how a company can protect itself against it

## Cyber ​​Security Challenge Belgium

The [Cyber ​​Security Challenge Belgium](https://www.cybersecuritychallenge.be/) is a competition aimed at computer science students, organized by [NVISO](https://www.nviso.eu/) and [Toreon](https : //www.toreon.com/). Register with your team, participate in the challenges and try to get as far as possible.

- On March 9-10 the "qualifiers" will take place: registered teams solve challenges via an online platform
- On March 26-27, the top teams will be allowed to participate in the final which (circumstances permitting) would take place in Brussels

Students from various colleges and universities from Flanders participate in the competition. HOGENT should also be represented! You don't have to be a cybersecurity specialist to participate. According to the organization, good general IT knowledge and motivation is the most important.

Also see this as an investment in your future: the competition is organized, sponsored and followed by companies that are looking for young talent to join their team. So, participation may be a stepping stone to an internship or job!

## Acceptance criteria

- We expect a detailed report and retrospective of your participation: what were the challenges, how did you resolve them or where did you get stuck? What were your team's strengths and what did you struggle with? As a student at HOGENT, did you think that you were well prepared to participate in the event? What can be improved in our programme?
- Reflect on the event during one of the following progress meetings.
