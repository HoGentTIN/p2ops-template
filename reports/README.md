# Instructions weekly progress reports

- Weekly reports are numbered according to the week **in which the progress meeting with your supervisor takes place**.
    - There is no progress interview in weeks 1 and 2, so no weekly report
    - A template for the progress reports is provided in file `weeknn.md`. Fill out all information that is to be repeated in each report (e.g. team member names).
    - For each progress meeting, prepare the report with the appropriate name by copying from the template. For week 3, that would bee `week03.md`.
- Each progress report covers the period starting from the day on which the previous meeting took place, up to and including the day before the current meeting
    - The first progress report, `week03.md` covers the period starting at the project kick-off!
    - As an example, project report for week 5 (`week05.md`) covers the period from Monday, 1 March 2021 to Sunday, 7 March
- Each student has completed their own contribution and timesheet **before the start of the progress interview**

Do not wait until the last moment to add your contributions to the report, but do this immediately after each time you have done work for the project. This way, the team has a minimum of work to complete the report before the next progress meeting. Your supervisor will fill out the attendances and any comments at the start of the progress meeting. The *Feedback* section at the bottom is also reserved for the supervisors.

Each team member must provide an individual **time registration report** with an overview of the time estimated and spent by means of a screenshot from Trello.

An example of the Markdown code to include an image:

    ```Markdown
    ![Time registration Pete, 15-21 February 2016](img/timesheet-w3-pete.jpg)
    ``

Every week, insert a screenshot of the status of the kanban board. Also always add a team overview of the time sheets, subdivided per sub-assignment for the period covered by the progress report.
