# Test plan assignment 1: (title)

(A test plan is an *exact* procedure of the actions you must perform to demonstrate that the assignment has been completed and that all specifications have been met. Any team member must be able to complete the tests using this procedure, without help from those responsible for the implementation. Results of the test are to be reported on in a separate document (the test report). Give the expected result for each step and how (which commands or actions) you can verify whether that result has been achieved. Choose the structure yourself: numbered list, table, sections, ... Use correct Markdown! Delete these instructions when the plan is finished.)
