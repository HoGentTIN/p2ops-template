# Assignment 1: Test setups for network equipment

## Assignment

As an ICT service provider, it is useful to standardize the equipment that you sell to one particular brand. This allows the employees to specialize extensively in the operation of that equipment and thus to be able to offer customers a better service. In the context of this project, the choice for network equipment is obvious, despite the sometimes considerable cost: Cisco.

It is important to get to know the equipment better so that later, we can apply it effectively in more complex situations. We will start with a few simple test setups with routers and switches. Before starting this, we ask you to create the PacketTracer lab for practicing commands related to the basic configuration of a switch from the Computer Networks 1 course.

- `command-01-Packettracer - basic configuration Switch.pka`: Basic configuration of a switch
- `command-01-lab1.pdf`: console session with a switch
- `command-01-lab2.pdf`: simple network with 2 switches
- `command-01-lab3.pdf`: simple network with router and switch
- `command-01-lab4.pdf`: more complex network with static routing

Automation of configuration is also becoming more and more common in network management. In order to gain experience with this, team members individually go through the workshop [Model-Driven Programmability](https://www.netacad.com/courses/infrastructure-automation/workshop-model-driven-programmability), perform the corresponding lab assignments, and take the final exam. Further instructions and access to the study material will be provided later.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Perform the Packettracer assignment (basic configuration) and make sure to get everything correct. So evaluation = 100%.
2. Perform the attached lab assignments in PacketTracer, demonstrate the operation to your supervisor and write a detailed report about it.
3. Lab 3 and 4 are also implemented on physical equipment and demonstrated to your supervisor (will be planned in W9-11).
4. It often happens that routers or switches still have settings left behind from a previous use. In the worst case, an admin password has been set and you cannot change anything anymore. It is therefore recommended to draw up a checklist / procedure with the steps required to reset the device to factory settings. Do this for both a router and a switch.
5. Keep a list (cheat sheet) of the most important basic commands for IOS. This will certainly come in handy later, for example if you have to give a demo to your supervisor!

## Deliverables

**Demo** during the follow-up meetings of:

- the setups of the 4 labs in PacketTracer
- the setups of labs 3 and 4 with physical hardware (if this is feasible within the applicable corona measures)

On Github:

- **PacketTracer files** with a simulation of the given setups
- Detailed **report** of realization of the test setups
- **Cheat sheet** with basic IOS commands
- Checklist: how do you **reset** any remaining settings on a Cisco router / switch?
